    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
    <p>The greatest mathemactician of the eighteenth century.<strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was bỏn in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics. <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler become a professor of physics and mathematics at St.Peterbug Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and paper. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, <em>Introductio in analysis infintiorum</em>(1748) remained a standard textbook for well over a century For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <em>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</em>(1768-1772),giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of aall time.</p>
    <p>One can hardy do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today,such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical anyalysis. Euler's formula</p>
    <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = e<sup>(ix)</sup></p>
    <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation</p>
    <p>e<sup>(Πi)</sup> + 1 = 0</p>
    <p>which relates the fundamentail constants: 0, 1, Π, e, and in a single beautiful and elgeant statement.</p>
    <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, andd certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
